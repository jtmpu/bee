# bee

suite of tools for automatically running and saving program output. TODO.

## bee

A utility program for saving stdout, stderr and files generated by programs. 

As simple as

```
bee nmap -Pn -n -vvv -sV -p 1-10000 127.0.0.1/32 
```

which will store all arguments, all stdout and stderr generated, timestamps and exit codes in the folder "~/.beehive"

All files generated in the local directory can be saved using:

```
bee -g nmap -Pn -n -vvv -sV -p 1-10000 -oA data 127.0.0.1/32 
```

This will create a new temporary folder in tmp, and copy all files from this folder upon program exit.

## bee-hive

Tool for easier access to output generated, in progress.
